## Projects

On this website, you can find a selection of projects I'm proud of, including:


Book Search Engine: A book search engine that allows users to create an account, search for books and read 
descriptions about each book, and save the names and descriptions of books they want to read. Users can also 
remove books from their saved book's list. This project uses MongoDB, Express, React, and Node. Check out the 
[deployed version](https://book-search-engine-8.herokuapp.com) or visit the [Github repo](https://github.com/cykj40/book-search-engine) for more information.

 

Tech Blog: A tech blog I created using an MVC framework. For the client side, I used Handlebars.js, CSS, and 
JavaScript. I created a MySQL database and connected the client side and the back end using Express and routing 
via (GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE). This project uses Handlebars, Express, and MySQL. Check out the [deployed version](https://tech-blog-888.herokuapp.com)
